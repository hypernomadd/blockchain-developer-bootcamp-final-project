2021 Concensys Arcademy blockchain bootcamp

## Project Summary
Blockchain based ananymous Review platform

## Project Background
Modern consumers refer to other people's reviews a lot when deciding to buy. However, companies pay money to buy reviewers and leave good reviews compared to the quality of the product to lower the integrity of the review. While studying the properties of the blockchain in Chapter 1, I thought I could solve this part, so I chose it as the subject of the final project.

## Review platform workflow
1. Users need to KYC for voating
2. Some users make valueable reviews
3. Other users voat for good or agree reviews
4. Who get many voats get platform tokens as reward
cf) We have to think about the system of clean voating!
